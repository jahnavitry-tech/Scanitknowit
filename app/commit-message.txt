feat: Implement Google Lens-style product scanner with multi-method recognition

This commit adds a complete product scanning solution that combines:
- QR code detection with jsQR (0.99 confidence for detected codes)
- OCR text extraction using Tesseract.js
- Object recognition with MobileNet via TensorFlow.js
- Optional image captioning through Hugging Face BLIP API
- Camera capture with torch support
- File upload functionality
- Ranked results display with confidence bars

The implementation includes:
- CameraPanel component for live camera capture and file uploads
- AnalysisPanel component for displaying ranked results
- App component for state management
- API endpoint with multipart/form-data handling
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Vercel deployment configuration
- Comprehensive deployment documentation

All recognition methods run in parallel for optimal performance, and results are merged and ranked by confidence. The frontend displays results with clear source identification and confidence indicators.
